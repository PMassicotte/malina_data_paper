                   coastal zones (i.e., Alaska, Canada, Greenland,
                   Norway and Rus-sia). The recent increase in air
                   temperature has resulted in increased precipitation
                   along the drainage basins of Arctic rivers. It has
                   also directly impacted land and seawater
                   tem-peratures with the consequence of melting
                   permafrost and sea ice. An increase in freshwater
                   discharge by main Arctic rivers has been clearly
                   identified in time series of field ob-servations. The
                   freshwater discharge of the Mackenzie River has
                   increased by 25 {\%} since 2003. This may have
                   increased the mobilization and transport of various
                   dissolved and par-ticulate substances, including
                   organic carbon, as well as their export to the ocean.
                   The release from land to the ocean of such organic
                   material, which has been sequestered in a frozen
                   state since the Last Glacial Maximum, may
                   significantly im-pact the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle
                   as well as marine ecosys-tems. In this study we use
                   11 years of ocean color satellite data and field
                   observations collected in 2009 to estimate the mass
                   of terrestrial suspended solids and particulate
                   organic carbon delivered by the Mackenzie River into

                   zone and in the river plume has increased by 46, 71
                   and 33 {\%}, respectively, since 2003. Combined with
                   the variations observed in the freshwater discharge,
                   this corre-sponds to a more than 50 {\%} increase in

  abstract =      {Riverine exports of organic and inorganic carbon (OC,
                   IC) to oceans are intricately linked to processes
                   occurring on land. Across high latitudes, thawing
                   permafrost, alteration of hydrologic flow paths, and
                   changes in vegetation may all affect this flux, with
                   subsequent implications for regional and global
                   carbon (C) budgets. Using a unique, multi-decadal
                   dataset of continuous discharge coupled with water
                   chemistry measurements for the Mackenzie River, we
                   show major increases in dissolved OC (DOC) and IC (as
                   alkalinity) fluxes since the early 1970s, for a
                   watershed that covers 1.8 M km2 of northwestern
                   Canada, and provides substantial inputs of freshwater
                   and biogeochemical constituents to the Arctic Ocean.
                   Over a 39-year period of record, DOC flux at the
                   Mackenzie mouth increased by 39.3{\%} (44.5 ± 22.6
                   Gmol), while alkalinity flux increased by 12.5{\%}
                   (61.5 ± 60.1 Gmol). Isotopic analyses and
                   substantial increases in sulfate flux indicate that
                   increases in alkalinity are driven by accelerating
                   sulfide oxidation, a process that liberates IC from
                   rock and soils in the absence of CO2 consumption.
                   Seasonal and sub-catchment trends suggest that
                   permafrost thaw plays an important role in the
                   observed increases in DOC and alkalinity:
                   sub-catchment increases for all constituents are
                   confined to northern, permafrost-affected regions,
                   while observed increases in autumn to winter are
                   consistent with documented landscape-scale changes
                   that have resulted from changing thaw dynamics. This
                   increase in DOC and sulfide-derived alkalinity
                   represents a substantial intensification of
                   land-to-ocean C mobilization, at a level that is
                   significant within the regional C budget. The change
                   we observe, for example, is similar to current and
                   projected future rates of CO2 consumption by
                   weathering in the Mackenzie basin.},

                   matter (tDOM) in the Arctic Ocean is limited by
                   persistent sea ice cover that reduces the amount of
                   ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the underlying
                   water column. UV-dependent processes are likely to
                   accelerate as a result of shrinking sea ice extent
                   and decreasing ice thickness caused by climatic
                   warming over this region. In this study, we made the
                   first quantitative estimates of photomineralization
                   of tDOM in a coastal Arctic ecosystem under current
                   and future sea ice regimes. We used an
                   optical-photochemical coupled model incorporating
                   water column optics and experimental measurements of
                   photoproduction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC),
                   the main carbon product of DOM photochemistry.
                   Apparent quantum yields of DIC photoproduction were
                   determined on water samples from the Mackenzie River
                   estuary, the Mackenzie Shelf, and Amundsen Gulf. UV
                   irradiances just below the sea surface were estimated
                   by combining satellite backscattered and passive
                   microwave radiance measurements with a radiative
                   transfer model. The mean annual DIC photoproduction
                   between 1979 and 2003 was estimated as 66.5 +/- 18.5
                   Gg carbon in the surface waters of the southeastern
                   Beaufort Sea, where UV absorption is dominated by
                   chromophoric dissolved organic matter discharged by
                   the Mackenzie River. This value is equivalent to
                   10{\%} of bacterial respiration rates, 8{\%} of new
                   primary production rates and 2.8 +/- 0.6{\%} of the
                   1.3 Tg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) discharged
                   annually by the Mackenzie River into the area. During
                   periods of reduced ice cover such as 1998, the latter
                   value could rise to 5.1{\%} of the annual riverine
                   DOC discharge. Under an ice-free scenario, the model
                   predicted that 150.5 Gg of DIC would be
                   photochemically produced, mineralizing 6.2{\%} of the
                   DOC input from the Mackenzie River. These results
                   show that the predicted trend of ongoing contraction
                   of sea ice cover will greatly accelerate the
                   photomineralization of tDOM in Arctic surface

                   necessary to allow phytoplankton to use river-derived
                   nitrate and to a lesser extent DON. A coarse budget
                   based on concurrent estimates of primary production
                   shows that river N deliveries support a modest
                   fraction of primary production when considering the
                   entire shelf, due to the ability of phytoplankton to
                   thrive in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum beneath
                   the thin, nitrate-depleted river plume. Away from
                   shallow coastal bays, local elevations in the
                   concentration of primary production and dissolved
                   organic constituents were consistent with upwelling
                   at the shelf break. By contrast with shallow winter
                   mixing, nutrient deliveries by North American rivers
                   and upwelling relax surface communities from N
                   limitation and permit a more extant utilization of
                   the excess SRP entering through the Bering Strait. In
                   this context, increased nitrogen supply by rivers and
                   upwelling potentially alters the vertical
                   distribution of the excess P exported into the North
                   Atlantic.},

                   hydrological data from a network of 54 hydrometric
                   stations and meteorological data from a network of 10

                   Concentrations of DOC elevate significantly with
                   increasing discharge in these rivers, causing
                   approximately 60{\%} of the annual export to occur
                   during a 2-month period following spring ice breakup.
                   We present a total annual flux from the five rivers
                   of ∼16 teragrams (Tg), and conservatively estimate
                   that the total input of DOC to the Arctic Ocean is
                   25-36 Tg, which is ∼5-20{\%} greater than previous
                   fluxes. These fluxes are also ∼2.5 × greater than
                   temperate rivers with similar watershed sizes and
                   water discharge. $\Delta$14C-DOC shows a clear
                   relationship with hydrology. A small pool of DOC
                   slightly depleted in $\Delta$14C is exported with
                   base flow. The large pool exported with spring thaw
                   is enriched in $\Delta$14C with respect to
                   current-day atmospheric $\Delta$14C-CO2 values. A
                   simple model predicts that ∼50{\%} of DOC exported
                   during the arctic spring thaw is 1-5 years old,
                   ∼25{\%} is 6-10 years in age, and 15{\%} is 11-20
                   years old. The dominant spring melt period, a
                   historically undersampled period export a large

                   changes should occur in the Arctic zone. The expected
                   destabilisation of permafrost and its consequences
                   for hydrology and plant cover should increase the
                   input of terrigenous carbon to coastal seas.
                   Consequently, the relative importance of the fluxes
                   of terrestrial and marine organic carbon to the
                   seafloor will likely change, strongly impacting the
                   preservation of organic carbon in Arctic marine
                   sediments. Here, we investigated the lipid content of
                   surface sediments collected on the Mackenzie basin in
                   the Beaufort Sea. Particular attention was given to
                   biotic and abiotic degradation products of sterols
                   and monounsaturated fatty acids. By using sitosterol
                   and campesterol degradation products as tracers of
                   the degradation of terrestrial higher plant inputs
                   and brassicasterol degradation products as tracers of
                   degradation of phytoplanktonic organisms, it could be
                   observed that autoxidation, photooxidation and
                   biodegradation processes act much more intensively on
                   higher plant debris than on phytoplanktonic
                   organisms. Examination of oxidation products of
                   monounsaturated fatty acids showed that photo- and
                   autoxidation processes act more intensively on
                   bacteria than on phytodetritus. Enhanced damages
                   induced by singlet oxygen (transferred from senescent
                   phytoplanktonic cells) in bacteria were attributed to
                   the lack of an adapted antioxidant system in these
                   microorganisms. The strong oxidative stress observed
                   in the sampled sediments resulted in the production
                   of significant amounts of epoxy acids and unusually
                   high proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids with
                   a trans double bond. The formation of epoxy acids was
                   attributed to peroxygenases (enzymes playing a
                   protective role against the deleterious effects of
                   fatty acid hydroperoxides in vivo), while cis/trans
                   isomerisation was probably induced by thiyl radicals
                   produced during the reaction of thiols with
                   hydroperoxides. Our results confirm the important
                   role played by abiotic oxidative processes in the
                   degradation of marine bacteria and do not support the
                   generally expected refractory character of
                   terrigenous material deposited in deltaic systems.},

                   markers, characteristic of known organic matter
                   sources, were grouped and used as proxies to evaluate

                   zooplankton material in the organic matter (OM) of
                   this area. Fossil and detrital algal contributions
                   were the major fractions of the freshwater SPM from
                   the Mackenzie River with {\~{}}34{\%} each of the
                   total molecular biomarkers. Fresh algal, C3
                   terrestrial, bacterial and zooplanktonic components
                   represented much lower percentages, 17, 10, 4 and
                   80{\%}), with a minor contribution of fossil and C3
                   terrestrial biomarkers. Characterization of the
                   sediments revealed a major sink of refractory algal
                   material mixed with some fresh algal material, fossil
                   hydrocarbons and a small input of C3 terrestrial
                   sources. In particular, the sediments from the shelf
                   and at the mouth of the Amundsen Gulf presented the
                   highest contribution of detrital algal material
                   (60–75{\%}), whereas those from the slope contained
                   the highest proportion of fossil (40{\%}) and C3
                   terrestrial plant material (10{\%}). Overall,
                   considering that the detrital algal material is
                   marine derived, autochthonous sources contributed
                   more than allochthonous sources to the OM lipid pool.
                   Using the ratio of an allochthonous biomarker
                   (normalized to total organic carbon, TOC) found in
                   the sediments to those measured at the river mouth
                   water, we estimated that the fraction of terrestrial
                   material preserved in the sediments accounted for
                   30–40{\%} of the total carbon in the inner shelf
                   sediments, 17{\%} in the outer shelf and Amundsen
                   Gulf and up to 25{\%} in the slope sediments. These
                   estimates are low compared to other studies conducted
                   5–20 yr earlier, and they support the increase in
                   primary production during the last decade mainly
                   because of the increase in the number of ice-free
                   days and due to the strength and persistence of winds
                   favouring upwelling.},

  abstract =      {Abstract. The effects of climate change on Arctic
                   marine ecosystems and their biogeochemical cycles are
                   difficult to predict given the complex physical,
                   biological and chemical interactions among the
                   ecosystem components. We studied benthic
                   biogeochemical fluxes in the Arctic and the influence
                   of short-term (seasonal to annual), long-term (annual
                   to decadal) and other environmental variability on
                   their spatial distribution to provide a baseline for
                   estimates of the impact of future changes. In summer
                   2009, we measured fluxes of dissolved oxygen,
                   nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, soluble reactive phosphate
                   and silicic acid at the sediment–water interface at
                   eight sites in the southeastern Beaufort Sea at water
                   depths from 45 to 580 m. The spatial pattern of the
                   measured benthic boundary fluxes was heterogeneous.
                   Multivariate analysis of flux data showed that no
                   single or reduced combination of fluxes could explain
                   the majority of spatial variation, indicating that
                   oxygen flux is not representative of other nutrient
                   sink–source dynamics. We tested the influence of
                   eight environmental parameters on single benthic
                   fluxes. Short-term environmental parameters (sinking
                   flux of particulate organic carbon above the bottom,
                   sediment surface Chl a) were most important for
                   explaining oxygen, ammonium and nitrate fluxes.
                   Long-term parameters (porosity, surface manganese and
                   iron concentration, bottom water oxygen
                   concentrations) together with $\delta$13Corg
                   signature explained most of the spatial variation in
                   phosphate, nitrate and nitrite fluxes. Variation in
                   pigments at the sediment surface was most important
                   to explain variation in fluxes of silicic acid. In a
                   model including all fluxes synchronously, the overall
                   spatial distribution could be best explained (57{\%})
                   by the combination of sediment Chl a, phaeopigments,
                   $\delta$13Corg, surficial manganese and bottom water
                   oxygen concentration. We conclude that it is
                   necessary to consider long-term environmental
                   variability along with rapidly ongoing environmental
                   changes to predict the flux of oxygen and nutrients
                   across Arctic sediments even at short timescales. Our
                   results contribute to improve ecological models
                   predicting the impact of climate change on the
                   functioning of marine ecosystems.},

                   precipitation, thawing of permafrost and coastal
                   erosion. Direct consequences have been observed on
                   the increasing Arctic river flow and a large amount
                   of organic carbon sequestered in soils at high
                   latitudes since the last glacial maximum can be
                   expected to be delivered to the Arctic Ocean during
                   the coming decade. Monitoring the fluxes and fate of
                   this terrigenous organic carbon is problematic in
                   such sparsely populated regions unless remote sensing
                   techniques can be developed and proved to be
                   operational. The main objective of this study is to
                   develop an ocean colour algorithm to operationally
                   monitor dynamics of suspended particulate matter
                   (SPM) on the Mackenzie River continental shelf
                   (Canadian Arctic Ocean) using satellite imagery. The
                   water optical properties are documented across the
                   study area and related to concentrations of SPM and
                   particulate organic carbon (POC). Robust SPM and POC
                   : SPM proxies are identified, such as the light
                   backscattering and attenuation coefficients, and
                   relationships are established between these optical
                   and biogeochemical parameters. Following a
                   semi-analytical approach, a regional SPM
                   quantification relationship is obtained for the
                   inversion of the water reflectance signal into SPM
                   concentration. This relationship is reproduced based
                   on independent field optical measurements. It is
                   successfully applied to a selection of MODIS
                   satellite data which allow estimating fluxes at the
                   river mouth and monitoring the extension and dynamics
                   of the Mackenzie River surface plume in 2009, 2010
                   and 2011. Good agreement is obtained with field
                   observations representative of the whole water column
                   in the river delta zone where terrigenous SPM is
                   mainly constrained (out of short periods of maximum
                   river outflow). Most of the seaward export of SPM is
                   observed to occur within the west side of the river
                   mouth. Future work will require the validation of the
                   developed SPM regional algorithm based on match-ups
                   with field measurements, then the routine application
                   to ocean colour satellite data in order to better
                   estimate the fluxes and fate of SPM and POC delivered

                   sensing reflectance (Rrs) was further examined using
                   a radiative transfer model. A 10-fold particle
                   enrichment homogeneously distributed in the first
                   meter of the water column slightly reduced
                   photosynthetically available and usable radiation
                   (PAR and PUR) by {\&}sim;6 and {\&}sim;8{\%},
                   respectively, relative to a fully homogenous water
                   column with low particle concentration. In terms of
                   Rrs, the particle enrichment significantly flattered
                   the spectrum by reducing the Rrs by up to 20{\%} in
                   the blue-green spectral region (400–550 nm). These
                   results highlight the impact of meltwater on the
                   concentration of particles at sea surface, and the
                   need for considering non-uniform vertical
                   distribution of particles in such systems when
                   interpreting remotely sensed ocean color. Spectral
                   slope of aNAP spectra calculated in the UV
                   (ultraviolet) domain decreased with depth suggesting
                   that this parameter is sensitive to detritus
                   composition and/or diagenesis state (e.g., POM

                   important role in the heat budget of the Arctic
                   Ocean, contributing to the recent decline in sea ice,

                   investigated aCDOM($\lambda$) in the Southern
                   Beaufort Sea where a significant amount of CDOM is
                   delivered by the Mackenzie River. In the surface
                   layer, aCDOM(440) showed a strong and negative
                   correlation with salinity, indicating strong river
                   influence and conservative transport in the river
                   plume. Below the mixed layer, a weak but positive
                   correlation between aCDOM(440) and salinity was
                   observed above the upper halocline, resulting from
                   the effect of removal of CDOM due to brine rejection
                   and lateral intrusion of Pacific summer waters into
                   these layers. In contrast, the relationship was
                   negative in the upper and the lower haloclines,
                   suggesting these waters originated from Arctic
                   coastal waters. DOC concentrations in the surface
                   layer were strongly correlated with aCDOM(440) (r2 =
                   0.97), suggesting that this value can be estimated in
                   this area, using aCDOM(440) that is retrieved using
                   satellite ocean color data. Implications for
                   estimation of DOC concentrations in surface waters

                   during water treatment, limited direct parallel
                   comparison of bromine versus chlorine has been
                   conducted. Experiments with model compounds and
                   natural waters indicated more efficient substitution
                   reactions with bromine than chlorine. Kinetic
                   experiments with NOM isolates with and without
                   pre-ozonation were conducted to obtain second-order
                   rate constants (k) with bromine and chlorine.
                   Two-stage reaction kinetics (rapid initial and slower
                   consumption stages) were observed. Bromine reacted
                   about 10 times faster than chlorine with NOM isolates
                   during both stages. The rapid initial stage reactions
                   were too fast to quantify k values, but qualitative
                   estimates ranged between 500 and 5000M -1s-1. For the
                   slower second stage k values for bromine were 15 to
                   167M-1s-1 over the pH range of 5-11, and lower for
                   chlorine (k = 0.7-5M-1s-1). Values of k correlated
                   with initial SUVA values of NOM (UVA measured at
                   254nm divided by DOC). Based upon UV/VIS and
                   solid-state 13C-NMR spectroscopy, chlorine addition
                   to a NOM isolate resulted in significant oxidation of
                   aromatic and ketone groups while bromine had
                   significantly less change in spectra. Overall, the
                   improved knowledge that bromine reacts faster and
                   substitutes more efficiently than chlorine will be
                   useful in developing strategies to control

                   and nitrogen (DOC, DON) was studied in three Finnish
                   boreal estuaries with contrasting land use patterns
                   (Kiiminkijoki - natural forest and peatland;
                   Kyronjoki - agricultural; Karjaanjoki - mixed/urban).
                   Bioassays of 12-18 d long durations were used in 3
                   seasons at in situ temperatures. Besides the bulk
                   parameters, a suite of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
                   quality parameters were also investigated, including
                   colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM and the molecular
                   weight of DOM. Bioavailable DOC and DON pools varied
                   significantly between the estuaries, from 7.9 to
                   10.6{\%} and from 5.5 to 21.9{\%}, respectively. DOM
                   originating from the catchment dominated by natural
                   forests and peatlands (Kiiminkijoki) had the lowest
                   DOC and DON degradation rates, as well as the lowest
                   proportions of biodegradable DOC and DON. A greater
                   proportion of agricultural land in the catchment
                   increased the bioavailability of DON, but not the
                   bioavailability of DOC (Kyronjoki). Additionally, DOM
                   quality varied significantly between the estuaries,
                   and DOM originating from the agricultural Kyronjoki
                   catchment sustained higher DOC and DON degradation
                   rates and higher bacterial growth efficiency (BGE)
                   compared to those of the natural forest and peat
                   dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment. The quality of DOM,
                   indicated by differences in CDOM, fluorescent DOM and
                   molecular weight, varied between estuaries with
                   differing land use and was concluded to be major
                   driver of BGE of these systems and thereafter to the
                   microbial CO sub(2) fluxes from the estuaries. The
                   differences in BGE resulted in a 5-fold difference in
                   the calculated daily bacterial CO sub(2) emissions
                   between the study's estuaries due to bacterial
                   activity, ranging from 40 kg C d super(-1) in the
                   Karjaanjoki estuary to 200 kg C d super(-1) in the
                   Kyronjoki estuary. Lower DOC:DON ratios, smaller
                   molecular weight and higher CDOM absorption spectral
                   slope values of DOM resulted in higher proportion of
                   the initial DOC and DON being transferred to
                   microbial growth and therefore to the pelagic food
                   web. The pristine, peatland and forest-dominated
                   Kiiminkijoki catchment had the lowest BGE, and
                   therefore proportionally highest CO sub(2) fluxes.},

                   carbon (DOC) concentrations and absorption of
                   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
                   distributed over four continents and seven oceans, we
                   described the global distribution and transformation
                   of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the aquatic
                   continuum across rivers and lakes to oceans. A strong
                   log-linear relationship (R 2  = 0.92) between DOC
                   concentration and CDOM absorption at 350 nm was
                   observed at a global scale, but was found to be
                   ecosystem-dependent at local and regional scales. Our
                   results reveal that as DOM is transported towards the
                   oceans, the robustness of the observed relation
                   decreases rapidly (R 2 from 0.94 to 0.44) indicating
                   a gradual decoupling between DOC and CDOM. This
                   likely reflects the decreased connectivity between
                   the landscape and DOM along the aquatic continuum. To
                   support this hypothesis, we used the DOC-specific UV
                   absorbance (SUVA) to characterize the reactivity of
                   the DOM pool which decreased from 4.9 to 1.7 m 2 ×
                   gC  −1 along the aquatic continuum. Across the
                   continuum, a piecewise linear regression showed that
                   the observed decrease of SUVA occurred more rapidly
                   in freshwater ecosystems compared to marine water
                   ecosystems, suggesting that the different degradation
                   processes act preferentially on CDOM rather than
                   carbon content. The observed change in the DOM
                   characteristics along the aquatic continuum also
                   suggests that the terrestrial DOM pool is gradually
                   becoming less reactive, which has profound
                   consequences on cycling of organic carbon in aquatic
                   ecosystems.},

                   concentrations of DOC ranged from 60 to 118 $\mu$M
                   with elevated values in the East Greenland Current
                   (EGC) which transports water from the Arctic Ocean to
                   the North Atlantic. EGC surface waters also showed a
                   pronounced fluorescence maximum between 30 and 120 m
                   depth in all EGC sections indicating the abundance of
                   Arctic river derived DOC in this current. Based on
                   fluorescence we estimated that 20-50{\%} of the
                   annual river discharge to the Arctic Ocean was
                   exported in the EGC. The fluorescence maximum was
                   typically associated with salinity around 33 and
                   temperatures below - 1°C which are characteristic of
                   surface and upper halocline water in the Arctic
                   Ocean. The elevated fluorescence in this water mass
                   suggests a strong Eurasian shelf component and also
                   suggests that in situ fluorescence could be used to
                   trace Eurasian shelf water in the central Arctic
                   Ocean. DOC concentrations in the Nordic Sea basins
                   ({\textgreater}1000 m) were relatively high (∼50
                   $\mu$M DOC) compared with other ocean basins
                   indicating active vertical transport of DOC in this
                   region on decadal timescales. Based on existing
                   vertical transport estimates and 15 $\mu$M of
                   semilabile DOC we calculated an annual vertical net
                   DOC export of 3.5 Tg C yr-1 in the Greenland Sea and
                   about 36 Tg C yr-1 for the entire Arctic
                   Mediterranean Sea (AMS) including the
                   Greenland-Scotland Ridge overflow. It appears that

  abstract =      {Abstract. A data set of radiometric measurements
                   collected in the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic) in
                   August 2009 (Malina project) is analyzed in order to
                   describe apparent optical properties (AOPs) in this
                   sea, which has been subject to dramatic environmental
                   changes for several decades. The two properties
                   derived from the measurements are the spectral
                   diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward
                   irradiance, Kd, and the spectral remote sensing
                   reflectance, Rrs. The former controls light
                   propagation in the upper water column. The latter
                   determines how light is backscattered out of the
                   water and becomes eventually observable from a
                   satellite ocean color sensor. The data set includes
                   offshore clear waters of the Beaufort Basin as well
                   as highly turbid waters of the Mackenzie River
                   plumes. In the clear waters, we show Kd values that
                   are much larger in the ultraviolet and blue parts of
                   the spectrum than what could be anticipated
                   considering the chlorophyll concentration. A larger
                   contribution of absorption by colored dissolved
                   organic matter (CDOM) is responsible for these high
                   Kd values, as compared to other oligotrophic areas.
                   In turbid waters, attenuation reaches extremely high
                   values, driven by high loads of particulate materials
                   and also by a large CDOM content. In these two
                   extreme types of waters, current satellite
                   chlorophyll algorithms fail. This questions the role
                   of ocean color remote sensing in the Arctic when Rrs
                   from only the blue and green bands are used.
                   Therefore, other parts of the spectrum (e.g., the
                   red) should be explored if one aims at quantifying
                   interannual changes in chlorophyll in the Arctic from
                   space. The very peculiar AOPs in the Beaufort Sea
                   also advocate for developing specific light
                   propagation models when attempting to predict light
                   availability for photosynthesis at depth.},

                   a wide dynamic range of in-water properties. The new
                   free-falling instrument, the Compact-Optical
                   Profiling System (C-OPS), was based on sensors built
                   with a cluster of 19 state-of-the-art
                   microradiometers spanning 320–780 nm and a novel
                   kite-shaped backplane. The new backplane includes
                   tunable ballast, a hydrobaric buoyancy chamber, plus
                   pitch and roll adjustments, to provide unprecedented
                   stability and vertical resolution in near-surface
                   waters. A unique data set was collected as part of
                   the development activity plus the first major field
                   campaign that used the new instrument, the Malina
                   expedition to the Beaufort Sea in the vicinity of the
                   Mackenzie River outflow. The data were of sufficient
                   resolution and quality to show that errors – more
                   correctly, uncertainties – in the execution of data
                   sampling protocols were measurable at the 1{\%} and 1

                   analysis as a function of three water types
                   established by the peak in the remote sensing
                   reflectance spectrum, Rrs($\lambda$), revealed which
                   water types and which parts of the spectrum were the
                   most sensitive to data acquisition uncertainties.
                   Shallow riverine waters were the most sensitive water
                   type, and the ultraviolet and near-infrared spectral
                   end members, which are critical to next-generation
                   satellite missions, were the most sensitive parts of
                   the spectrum. The sensitivity analysis also showed
                   how the use of data products based on band ratios
                   significantly mitigated the influence of data
                   acquisition uncertainties. The unprecedented vertical
                   resolution provided high-quality data products, which
                   supported an alternative classification capability
                   based on the spectral diffuse attenuation
                   coefficient, Kd($\lambda$). The Kd(320) and Kd(780)
                   data showed how complex coastal systems can be
                   distinguished two-dimensionally and how near-ice
                   water masses are different from the neighboring open
                   ocean. Finally, an algorithm for predicting the
                   spectral absorption due to colored dissolved organic
                   matter (CDOM), denoted aCDOM($\lambda$), was
                   developed using the Kd(320) / Kd(780) ratio, which
                   was based on a linear relationship with respect to
                   aCDOM(440). The robustness of the approach was
                   established by expanding the use of the algorithm to
                   include a geographically different coastal
                   environment, the Southern Mid-Atlantic Bight, with no
                   significant change in accuracy (approximately 98{\%}
                   of the variance explained). Alternative spectral end
                   members reminiscent of next-generation (340 and 710
                   nm) as well as legacy satellite missions (412 and 670
                   nm) were also used to accurately derive aCDOM(440)
                   from Kd($\lambda$) ratios.},

                   is fundamental to understanding nitrogen
                   biogeochemistry in aquatic ecosystems. Unfortunately,
                   the commonly used indophenol blue method often yields
                   inconsistent results, particularly when ammonium
                   concentrations are low. Here, we present a
                   fluorometric method that gives precise measurements
                   of ammonium over a wide range of concentrations and
                   salinities emphasizing submicromolar levels. The

                   also substantially simplifies sample collection and
                   preservation. It uses a single working reagent
                   (consisting of orthophthaldialdehyde, sodium sulfite,
                   and sodium borate) that is stable for months when
                   stored in the dark. The working reagent and sample
                   can be mixed immediately after sample collection and
                   the reaction proceeds to completion within 3 h at
                   room temperature. Matrix effects and background
                   fluorescence can be corrected without introducing
                   substantial error. This simple method produces highly

                   allows simultaneous determination of organic forms of
                   carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP)
                   dissolved in seawater. Conversion of dissolved
                   organic matter (DOM) to inorganic products (carbon
                   dioxide, nitrate + nitrite and soluble reactive
                   phosphate) is performed by a persulfate wet-oxidation
                   in low alkaline condition. After oxidation, the
                   concentration of the inorganic products dissolved in
                   the sample was measured automatically by colorimetry
                   using a 3-channel Technicon AutoAnalyzer system. A
                   number of pure organic compounds were tested in the
                   concentration range encountered in coastal and open
                   ocean, indicating a high efficiency of the digestion
                   procedure. The recovery range is similar to that
                   obtained by other wet-oxidation procedures and by
                   high-temperature catalytic oxidation techniques.
                   Direct comparisons with usual methods used for
                   separate determination of DOC, DON and DOP indicated
                   a high efficiency of the procedure. Reproducibility
                   tests demonstrated a very good precision (around
                   5{\%}) for lagoonal and coastal waters, while
                   precision was sometimes around 10-25{\%} in
                   oligotrophic oceanic waters, especially for DOP where
                   values approached limits of detection for measuring
                   phosphate. This method is highly suitable for routine
                   analysis and especially appropriate for shipboard
                   work.},

                   the spatial distribution and structure of
                   phytoplankton pigments was investigated along a
                   transect crossing the ultra-oligotrophic South
                   Pacific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG) between the Marquesas
                   Archipelago (141° W–8° S) and the Chilean
                   upwelling (73° W–34° S). A High Performance
                   Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method was improved in
                   order to be able to accurately quantify pigments over
                   such a large range of trophic levels, and especially
                   from strongly oligotrophic conditions. Seven
                   diagnostic pigments were associated to three
                   phytoplankton size classes (pico-, nano and
                   microphytoplankton). The total chlorophyll-$\alpha$
                   concentrations [TChl$\alpha$] in surface waters were
                   the lowest measured in the centre of the gyre,
                   reaching 0.017 mg m−3. Pigment concentrations at
                   the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) were generally 10
                   fold the surface values. Results were compared to
                   predictions from a global parameterisation based on
                   remotely sensed surface [TChl$\alpha$]. The agreement
                   between the in situ and predicted data for such
                   contrasting phytoplankton assemblages was generally
                   good: throughout the oligotrophic gyre system,
                   picophytoplankton (prochlorophytes and cyanophytes)
                   and nanophytoplankton were the dominant classes.
                   Relative bacteriochlorophyll-$\alpha$ concentrations
                   varied around 2{\%}. The transition zone between the
                   Marquesas and the SPSG was also well predicted by the
                   model. However, some regional characteristics have
                   been observed where measured and modelled data
                   differ. Amongst these features is the extreme depth
                   of the DCM (180 m) towards the centre of the gyre,
                   the presence of a deep nanoflagellate population
                   beneath the DCM or the presence of a
                   prochlorophyte-enriched population in the formation
                   area of the high salinity South Pacific Tropical
                   Water. A coastal site sampled in the eutrophic
                   upwelling zone, characterised by recently upwelled

                   picoeucaryotes, in contrast with an offshore

                   recent environmental changes of the Arctic Ocean. In
                   terms of bottom-up control, modifying the
                   phytoplankton distribution will ultimately affect the
                   entire food web and carbon export. However, detecting
                   and quantifying changes in phytoplankton communities
                   in the Arctic Ocean remains difficult because of the
                   lack of data and the inconsistent identification
                   methods used. Based on pigment and microscopy data
                   sampled in the Beaufort Sea during summer 2009, we
                   optimized the chemotaxonomic tool CHEMTAX (CHEMical
                   TAXonomy) for the assessment of phytoplankton
                   community composition in an Arctic setting. The
                   geographical distribution of the main phytoplankton
                   groups was determined with clustering methods. Four
                   phytoplankton assemblages were determined and related
                   to bathymetry, nutrients and light availability.
                   Surface waters across the whole survey region were
                   dominated by prasinophytes and chlorophytes, whereas
                   the subsurface chlorophyll maximum was dominated by
                   the centric diatoms Chaetoceros socialis on the shelf
                   and by two populations of nanoflagellates in the deep
                   basin. Microscopic counts showed a high contribution
                   of the heterotrophic dinoflagellates Gymnodinium and
                   Gyrodinium spp. to total carbon biomass, suggesting
                   high grazing activity at this time of the year.
                   However, CHEMTAX was unable to detect these
                   dinoflagellates because they lack peridinin. In
                   heterotrophic dinoflagellates, the inclusion of the
                   pigments of their prey potentially leads to incorrect
                   group assignments and some misinterpretation of
                   CHEMTAX. Thanks to the high reproducibility of
                   pigment analysis, our results can serve as a baseline
                   to assess change and spatial or temporal variability
                   in several phytoplankton populations that are not
                   affected by these misinterpretations.},

                   Ocean, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and the

                   photosynthetic microorganisms occurring in the Arctic
                   during the summer season, strains were isolated by
                   flow cytometry sorting (FCS) and single cell
                   pipetting before or after phytoplankton enrichment of
                   seawater samples. Strains were isolated both onboard
                   and back in the laboratory and cultured at 4 °C

                   (SEM and TEM), as well as 18S and 28S rRNA gene
                   sequencing. These strains group into 20 genotypes and

                   structure prediction revealed that these four clades

                   neogracilis generally occurred as single cells but
                   also formed short colonies. It is phylogenetically

                   identified in some previous studies as C.

                   species, although clearly separated by molecular
                   features. Here we examine four Mamiellophyceae
                   strains from the Canadian Arctic. The 18S rRNA and
                   Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) gene phylogeny
                   place these strains within the family Mamiellaceae
                   (Mamiellales, Mamiellophyceae) in two separate clades
                   of the genus Mantoniella. ITS2 synapomorphies support
                   their placement as two new species, Mantoniella
                   beaufortii and Mantoniella baffinensis. Both species
                   have round green cells with diameter between 3–5
                   µm, one long flagellum and a short reduced flagellum

                   covered by spiderweb-like scales, making both species
                   similar to other Mantoniella species.
                   Morphologically, M. beaufortii and M. baffinensis are
                   most similar to the cosmopolitan M. squamata with
                   only minor differences in scale structure

                   metabarcoding datasets indicates M. beaufortii has
                   only been recorded in seawater and sea ice samples
                   from the Arctic while no environmental barcode
                   matches M. baffinensis. Like other Mamiellophyceae
                   genera that have distinct polar and temperate
                   species, the polar distribution of these new species

                   erection of P. arctica is mainly supported by
                   molecular data, since the species shares identical
                   ultrastructure with another species in the complex,
                   P. fryxelliana, and represents a new case of
                   crypticity within the genus. Despite their
                   morphological similarity, the two species are not
                   closely related in phylogenies based on LSU, ITS and
                   rbcL. Interestingly, P. arctica is phylogenetically
                   most closely related to P. granii and P. subcurvata,
                   from which the species is, however, morphologically
                   different. P. granii and P. subcurvata lack the
                   central larger interspace which is one of the
                   defining features of the P. pseudodelicatissima
                   complex. The close genetic relationship between P.
                   arctica and the two species P. granii and P.
                   subcurvata is demonstrated by analysis of the
                   secondary structure of ITS2 which revealed no
                   compensatory base changes, two hemi‐compensatory
                   base changes, and two deletions in P. arctica with
                   respect to the other two species. These findings
                   emphasize that rates of morphological
                   differentiation, molecular evolution and speciation
                   are often incongruent for Pseudo‐nitzschia species,

                   purpose was to evaluate bacterial organic carbon
                   processing with respect to local sources, mainly
                   primary production and river inputs. Bacterial
                   production and abundance generally decreased from

                   waters. In contrast, the percentage of high nucleic

                   in surface or river waters. Statistical analyses

                   controlled by temperature and the availability of
                   labile organic matter, as indicated by total

                   (DOM) plays an important role in marine
                   biogeochemical cycles, including the regeneration of
                   inorganic nutrients. DOM photochemistry affects
                   nitrogen cycling by converting bio-refractory
                   dissolved organic nitrogen to labile inorganic
                   nitrogen, mainly ammonium (NH4+). During the August
                   2009 Mackenzie Light and Carbon (MALINA) Program, the
                   absorbed photon-based efficiency spectra of NH4+
                   photoproduction (i.e. photoammonification) were
                   determined using water samples from the SE Beaufort
                   Sea, including the Mackenzie River estuary, shelf,
                   and Canada Basin. The photoammonification efficiency
                   decreased with increasing wavelength across the
                   ultraviolet and visible regimes and was higher in
                   offshore waters than in shelf and estuarine waters.
                   The efficiency was positively correlated with the
                   molar nitrogen:carbon ratio of DOM and negatively
                   correlated with the absorption coefficient of
                   chromophoric DOM (CDOM). Combined with collateral
                   measurements of CO2 and CO photoproduction, this

                   with a CO2 : CO : NH4+ molar ratio of 165 : 11 : 1 in
                   the estuary, 60 : 3 : 1 on the shelf, and 18 : 2 : 1
                   in the Canada Basin. The NH4+ efficiency spectra,
                   along with solar photon fluxes, CDOM absorption
                   coefficients and sea ice concentrations, were used to
                   model the monthly surface and depth-integrated
                   photoammonification rates in 2009. The summertime
                   (June–August) rates at the surface reached 6.6 nmol
                   l−1 d−1 on the Mackenzie Shelf and 3.7 nmol l−1
                   d−1 further offshore; the depth-integrated rates
                   were correspondingly 8.8 $\mu$mol m−2 d−1 and
                   11.3 $\mu$mol m−2 d−1. The offshore
                   depth-integrated rate in August (8.0 $\mu$mol m−2
                   d−1) was comparable to the missing dissolved
                   inorganic nitrogen (DIN) source required to support
                   the observed primary production in the upper 10-m
                   layer of that area. The yearly NH4+ photoproduction
                   in the entire study area was estimated to be 1.4 ×
                   108 moles, with 85{\%} of it being generated in
                   summer when riverine DIN input is low.
                   Photoammonification could mineralize 4{\%} of the
                   annual dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) exported from
                   the Mackenzie River and provide a DIN source
                   corresponding to 7{\%} of the riverine DIN discharge
                   and 1400 times the riverine NH4+ flux. Under a
                   climate warming-induced ice-free scenario, these
                   quantities could increase correspondingly to 6{\%},
                   11{\%}, and 2100 times. Photoammonification is thus a
                   significant nitrogen cycling term and may fuel
                   previously unrecognized autotrophic and heterotrophic
                   production pathways in the surface SE Beaufort Sea.},

  abstract =      {Abstract. One of the major objectives of the BIOSOPE
                   cruise, carried out on the R/V Atalante from
                   October-November 2004 in the South Pacific Ocean, was
                   to establish productivity rates along a zonal section
                   traversing the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre (SPG).
                   These results were then compared to measurements
                   obtained from the nutrient – replete waters in the
                   Chilean upwelling and around the Marquesas Islands. A
                   dual 13C/15N isotope technique was used to estimate
                   the carbon fixation rates, inorganic nitrogen uptake
                   (including dinitrogen fixation), ammonium (NH4) and
                   nitrate (NO3) regeneration and release of dissolved
                   organic nitrogen (DON). The SPG exhibited the lowest
                   primary production rates (0.15 g C m−2 d−1),
                   while rates were 7 to 20 times higher around the
                   Marquesas Islands and in the Chilean upwelling,
                   respectively. In the very low productive area of the
                   SPG, most of the primary production was sustained by
                   active regeneration processes that fuelled up to
                   95{\%} of the biological nitrogen demand.
                   Nitrification was active in the surface layer and
                   often balanced the biological demand for nitrate,
                   especially in the SPG. The percentage of nitrogen
                   released as DON represented a large proportion of the
                   inorganic nitrogen uptake (13–15{\%} in average),
                   reaching 26–41{\%} in the SPG, where DON production
                   played a major role in nitrogen cycling. Dinitrogen
                   fixation was detectable over the whole study area;
                   even in the Chilean upwelling, where rates as high as
                   3 nmoles l−1 d−1 were measured. In these
                   nutrient-replete waters new production was very high
                   (0.69±0.49 g C m−2 d−1) and essentially
                   sustained by nitrate levels. In the SPG, dinitrogen
                   fixation, although occurring at much lower daily
                   rates (≈1–2 nmoles l−1 d−1), sustained up to
                   100{\%} of the new production (0.008±0.007 g C m−2
                   d−1) which was two orders of magnitude lower than
                   that measured in the upwelling. The annual
                   N2-fixation of the South Pacific is estimated to
                   21×1012g, of which 1.34×1012g is for the SPG only.
                   Even if our "snapshot" estimates of N2-fixation rates
                   were lower than that expected from a recent ocean
                   circulation model, these data confirm that the
                   N-deficiency South Pacific Ocean would provide an
                   ideal ecological niche for the proliferation of
                   N2-fixers which are not yet identified.},

                   ammonium regeneration, nitrification, and vertical
                   flux of particulate matter were measured in the
                   equatorial Pacific at 21 daily productivity stations
                   occupied on a meridional transect (150°W) between
                   1°N and 16°S. Three areas could be distinguished
                   along the transect: (1) the equatorial area between
                   1°N and 6°S, where nitrate concentrations were
                   typically eutrophic, reaching up to 3 $\mu$g-at L-1
                   in surface waters; (2) an intermediate mesotrophic
                   area between 6° and 10°S, where surface nitrate
                   concentrations decreased from 1 $\mu$g-at L-1 to
                   zero; and (3) the oligotrophic area beyond 10°S,
                   characterized by warm and nitrate poor waters.
                   Although nitrate was the main form of inorganic
                   nitrogen available for phytoplankton growth
                   (70{\%}-100{\%} of total), its uptake was severely
                   retarded in the equatorial sector. This lack of
                   nitrate depletion in the equatorial sector between 0
                   and 6°S may in part result from the important
                   ammonium supply (100 ng-at L-1 d-1) which could
                   sustain up to 85{\%} of total inorganic nitrogen
                   (nitrate + ammonium) utilization by phytoplankton. In
                   addition, regenerated production also resulted from
                   in situ nitrification (20-80 ng-atN L-1 d-1) which
                   can fuel 20{\%}-100{\%} of the nitrate uptake.
                   Sinking particles represented {\textless}10{\%} of
                   total carbon fixation and ∼10{\%}-50{\%} of new
                   production in terms of carbon and nitrogen. From
                   these discrepancies it was suggested that (1) new
                   production rates were overestimated because of the
                   high level of nitrification that provided
                   "regenerated nitrate" and (2) advection of dissolved
                   organic carbon and nitrogen played an important role
                   in export. The specific hydrodynamical circulation, a
                   conveyor belt generated by upwelling at the equator
                   and downwelling some degrees south, associated with
                   biological in situ remineralization of ammonium and
                   nitrate as well, appeared to be a very efficient
                   system for recycling inorganic nitrogen in the
                   euphotic layer and thus for supporting the high
                   regenerated production levels. On the other hand, the
                   high nitrate/silicate ratios ({\textgreater}1.5)
                   observed in the upwelling waters seemed to indicate
                   that silicate is not efficiently recycled in this
                   specific circulation system because of its low
                   regeneration rate as well as its sink via rapidly
                   sedimenting diatoms cell walls; this may be also true
                   for iron. This reinforces the idea of Si and/or Fe
                   limitation which was put forward earlier to explain
                   low new production levels in the equatorial Pacific.

                   Arctic Ocean. Phytoplankton dynamics in this
                   environment are driven by extreme physical gradients
                   and by rapid climate change, which influence light
                   and nutrient availability as well as the growth and
                   ecological characteristics of phytoplankton. A large
                   dataset collected across the Canadian Beaufort Shelf
                   during summer 2009 was analyzed to assess how the
                   interplay of physical and biogeochemical conditions
                   dictates phytoplankton niches and trophic regimes.
                   Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and cluster
                   analysis demonstrated marked partitioning of
                   phytoplankton diversity. Elevated phytoplankton
                   biomass (∼ 2.41 $\mu$g Chl a L−1) was observed in
                   association with the surface mixed layer near the
                   coast, close to the mouth of the Mackenzie River, and
                   at the shelf-break as a result of nutrient-rich
                   Pacific water intrusions. The coastal communities
                   were supported by high levels of nitrogen nutrients
                   and were taxonomically uniform, with diatoms
                   accounting for 95{\%} of total cell numbers. By
                   contrast, adjacent oceanic waters were characterized
                   by low autotrophic biomass near the surface (∼ 0.09
                   $\mu$g Chl a L−1) and below the mixed layer (∼
                   0.23 $\mu$g Chl a L−1) due to mainly nutrient
                   limitation. However, the oceanic community was more
                   diverse with a mixed assemblage of diatoms and small
                   mixotrophs/heterotrophs near the surface and a
                   predominance of autotrophic nanoflagellates at depth.
                   We conclude that as climate change intensifies
                   freshening and stratification in the Western Arctic
                   Ocean, coastal hotspots of high autotrophic
                   productivity may play an even greater role in
                   supporting Arctic marine ecosystems while offshore
                   environments become increasingly oligotrophic.},

                   to infer the plankton ecosystem functioning and

                   sensitivity to key light-driven processes involved in

                   Photoammonification directly and indirectly (by
                   stimulating the microbial food web activity)
                   contributed to 70{\%} and 18.5{\%} of the 0–10 m

                   primary production (respectively 66{\%} and 16{\%}

                   suggested that variable carbon to chlorophyll ratios

                   nitrogen fluxes in the Beaufort Sea oligotrophic
                   waters. In face of accelerating Arctic warming, more

                   photoproduction is a useful indicator of substrate
                   photoreactivity and a crucial parameter for modeling
                   CO photoproduction rates in the water column. Recent
                   evidence has suggested that CO photoproduction from
                   particles in marine waters is significant compared to
                   the well-known CO production from chromophoric
                   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photodegradation.
                   Although CDOM-based CO AQY spectra have been
                   extensively determined, little is known of this
                   information on the particulate phase. Using water
                   samples collected from the Mackenzie estuary, shelf,
                   and Canada Basin in the southeastern Beaufort Sea,
                   the present study for the first time quantified the
                   AQY spectra of particle-based CO photoproduction and
                   compared them with the concomitantly determined
                   CDOM-based CO AQY spectra. CO AQYs of both particles
                   and CDOM decreased with wavelength but the spectral
                   shape of the particulate AQY was flatter in the
                   visible regime. This feature resulted in a
                   disproportionally higher visible light-driven CO
                   production by particles, thereby increasing the ratio
                   of particle- to CDOM-based CO photoproduction with
                   depth in the euphotic zone. In terms of
                   depth-integrated production in the euphotic zone, CO
                   formation from CDOM was dominated by the ultraviolet
                   (UV, 290–400 nm) radiation whereas UV and visible
                   light played roughly equal roles in CO production
                   from particles. Spatially, CO AQY of bulk particulate
                   matter (i.e. the sum of organics and inorganics)
                   augmented from the estuary and shelf to the basin
                   while CO AQY of CDOM trended inversely. Water from
                   the deep chlorophyll maximum layer revealed higher CO
                   AQYs than did surface water for both particles and
                   CDOM. CO AQY of bulk particulate matter exceeded that
                   of CDOM on the shelf and in the basin, but the
                   sequence reversed in the estuary. Without
                   consideration of the potential role of metal oxides
                   (e.g. iron oxides) in particle photochemistry,
                   mineral absorption-corrected CO AQY of particulate
                   organic matter (POM) could, however, surpass its CDOM
                   counterpart in all three sub-regions and displayed
                   magnitudes in the estuary that overtook those in
                   shelf and offshore waters. In terms of CO
                   photoproduction, POM was thus more photoreactive than
                   CDOM, irrespective of the organic matter's origins
                   (i.e. terrigenous or marine). Riverine CDOM exhibited
                   higher photoreactivity than marine CDOM and
                   land-derived POM appeared more photoreactive than
                   marine POM. AQY-based modeling indicates that CO
                   photoproduction in the study area is underestimated
                   by 12–32{\%} if the particulate term is ignored.},

                   spring 2004. Diurnal cycles of surface water CO
                   concentration ([CO]) occurred in autumn but not in
                   spring. In both seasons [CO] was well above
                   air-equilibrium at most stations (maximum of
                   12,500{\%} saturation) and dropped with depth to
                   undetectable levels below 50 m. Mean surface water
                   [CO] and CO water-column burdens (0-50 m) were 0.45
                   nmol L-1 and 5.0 $\mu$mol m-2 in autumn and 4.7 nmol
                   L-1 and 64.8 $\mu$mol m-2 in spring, and the
                   sea-to-air CO flux was 33 times higher in spring. The
                   efficiency of CO photoproduction correlated linearly
                   with CDOM across the Mackenzie River estuary, the
                   Mackenzie Shelf, and the Amundsen Gulf. Modeled
                   water-column CO photoproduction in spring was 15
                   times that in autumn (45.8 vs. 3.0 $\mu$mol m-2 d-1).
                   Microbial CO uptake followed first-order kinetics in
                   autumn while Hill-type, saturation, and inhibition
                   kinetics were common in surface waters in spring.
                   Bio-oxidation was the dominant CO loss term in autumn
                   while gas exchange was almost equally important in
                   spring. Higher photoproduction and slower bio-uptake
                   in spring resulted in the wide autumn-spring
                   differences in the [CO] distribution pattern and
                   air-sea CO flux. CO cycling in cold northern waters

                   across the Canadian Beaufort Shelf (Arctic Ocean) was
                   investigated. Our main goal was to quantify and
                   characterize the biotic and abiotic degradation
                   processes that acted on sinking material during these
                   periods. Diatoms, which dominated the phytoplanktonic
                   assemblage in every trap sample, appeared to be
                   remarkably sensitive to Type II (i.e. involving
                   singlet oxygen) photodegradation processes in summer,
                   but seemed to be relatively unaffected by biotic
                   degradation at the same time. Hence, the relative
                   recalcitrance of phytodetritus towards biodegradation
                   processes during the Arctic midnight sun period was
                   attributed to the strong photodegradation state of
                   heterotrophic bacteria, which likely resulted from
                   the efficient transfer of singlet oxygen from
                   photodegraded phytoplanktonic cells to attached
                   bacteria. In addition, the detection in trap samples
                   of photoproducts specific to wax ester components
                   found in herbivorous copepods demonstrated that
                   zooplanktonic faecal material exported out of the
                   euphotic zone in summer were affected by Type II
                   photodegradation processes as well. By contrast,
                   sinking particles collected during the autumn were
                   not influenced by any light-driven stress. Further
                   chemical analyses showed that photodegraded sinking
                   particles contained an important amount of intact
                   hydroperoxides, which could then induce a strong
                   oxidative stress in underlying sediments.},

                   with C (acetate and/or glucose), N (nitrate and/or

                   prokaryotic heterotrophic production was limited by
                   N, either alone (5 experiments) or in co-limitation

                   Diversity analyses (DNA- and RNA-based

                   organisms on the planet and dominate oceanic
                   biogeochemical cycles, including that of carbon.
                   Their role in polar waters has been enigmatic,
                   however, because of conflicting reports about how
                   temperature and the supply of organic carbon control
                   bacterial growth. In this Analysis article, we
                   attempt to resolve this controversy by reviewing
                   previous reports in light of new data on microbial
                   processes in the western Arctic Ocean and by
                   comparing polar waters with low-latitude oceans.
                   Understanding the regulation of in situ microbial
                   activity may help us understand the response of the
                   Arctic Ocean and Antarctic coastal waters over the
                   coming decades as they warm and ice coverage
                   declines.},

                   active bacterial community structure in a gradient
                   covering surface waters from the Mackenzie River to
                   the coastal Beaufort Sea in the Canadian Arctic
                   Ocean, with a particular focus on free-living (FL)
                   vs. particle-attached (PA) communities. Capillary
                   electrophoresis–single-strand conformation
                   polymorphism (CE-SSCP) showed significant differences
                   when comparing river, coast and open sea bacterial
                   community structures. In contrast to the river and
                   coastal waters, total (16S rDNA-based) and active
                   (16S rRNA-based) communities in the open sea samples
                   were not significantly different, suggesting that
                   most present bacterial groups were equally active in
                   this area. Additionally, we observed significant
                   differences between PA and FL bacterial community
                   structure in the open sea, but similar structure in
                   the two fractions for coastal and river samples.
                   Direct multivariate statistical analyses showed that
                   total community structure was mainly driven by
                   salinity (a proxy of dissolved organic carbon and
                   chromophoric dissolved organic matter), suspended
                   particles, amino acids and chlorophyll a.
                   Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from selected
                   samples confirmed significant differences between
                   river, coastal and sea samples. The PA fraction was
                   only different (15.7{\%} similarity) from the FL one
                   in the open sea sample. Furthermore, PA samples
                   generally showed higher diversity (Shannon, Simpson
                   and Chao indices) than FL samples. At the class
                   level, Opitutae was most abundant in the PA fraction
                   of the sea sample, followed by Flavobacteria and
                   Gammaproteobacteria, while the FL sea sample was
                   dominated by Alphaproteobacteria. Finally, for the
                   coast and river samples and both PA and FL fractions,
                   Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and
                   Actinobacteria were dominant. These results highlight
                   the coexistence of particle specialists and
                   generalists and the role of particle quality in
                   structuring bacterial communities in the area. These
                   results may also serve as a basis to predict further
                   changes in bacterial communities should climate
                   change lead to further increases in river discharge
                   and related particle loads.},
